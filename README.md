# MAP-UOT
## Background
Unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) has been widely used as a key algorithm in many application domains, where it often dominates the application running time. It is becoming a tool in a wider range of application domains utilizing machine learning (ML), such as computational biology, computational imaging, neuroimaging, natural language processing, domain adaptation, supervised learning, etc. We optimize UOT according to its memory-bound characteristics by interweaving the row rescaling and column rescaling that were originally performed independently to substantially reduce the memory access.

## Compile and install
The program can be compiled by the following command.
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../src
$ make
```

## Running
* Every executable file has a corresponding .sh file with the same name.
For example, you can measure GPU platform performance improvements with SH_UOT_GPU_new_performance.sh.
```bash
$ sh SH_UOT_GPU_new_performance.sh
```

## Result
When finishing executing, you can find running time results in .log file with the same name.
For example, SH_UOT_GPU_new_performance.log.
